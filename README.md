# Tech Academy Python Projects
A repository to hold the Python projects I complete for the tech academy full stack developer program.

NICE OR MEAN - full program
In the nice or mean file you will find a full program that asks a series of questions and keeps a score. Depending on how you answer the final question it will restart the game while retaining one of your answers or if you choose to quit the game it will ask to close the idle shell but if this was an executable if would close the program.
